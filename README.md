# buttermilk tweetPepper

This project was originally forked from https://github.com/ianopolous/tweetnacl-java/ which provided
the nucleus for the rest of the code. Because that fork was GPL'd I cannot include it in buttermilk.

See https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/ and https://nacl.cr.yp.to/ for details about "salt".

Bernstein et. al. present the big ideas here: https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/tweetnacl-20140917.pdf.

So, they can have the big ideas, I'm happy with that. I am working on a small idea, which is that a 
crypto library is not much use without a PKI to support it. 

tweetPepper provides some support for things like key formats, protecting keys, and also has some ideas
about how to use those in the context of twitter. 

More details to follow as the coding continues.
